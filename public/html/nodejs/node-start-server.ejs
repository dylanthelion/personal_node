				Once you have a server written in a Javascript file (in this case, 'index.js'), use the following command to start the server on your machine. Note that it will be served on a local port, meaning that this is not enough to serve pages from a web server, without further work (unless you start the server on port 80 or 443, which is not a great idea).
