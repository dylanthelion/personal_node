				To start a git repository with a tracked remote repository, first create a new project on github. Copy the URL in your browser, while inside of the empty project, and enter it in place of the 'my-URL' in the following commands. Also, make sure that you have a .gitignore ready and saved before the 'git add'. Finally, be aware that this will create master and develop branches both locally and remotely; it's a good idea to create other branches to continue your work from.
