				This is a bit of an edge case. I needed to replace the contents of an HTML node for this app. Generally, you'd waid until the DOM is loaded and do that, but I couldn't. So, I made sure that the node name was unique, and used Javascript to match the strings. The following function takes a string (the read document) and a second string (the content to insert), and returns the altered document content.

					function replaceNodeContent(oldCode, transformedCode) {
						var first = "<myNode>";
						var second = "</myNode>"
						var parts = oldCode.split(first);
						var parts2 = parts[1].split(second);
						parts2[0] = transformedCode;
						return [parts[0], parts2.join(second)].join(first);
					}
